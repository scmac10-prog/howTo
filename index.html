<h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put water in a kettle and turn on to heat up.</li>
        <li>Put 4 cups of flour and all other dry ingredients into a very large bowl and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour oil and milk into large glass measuring cup. If you don't have a large measuring cup, combine ingredients in a pot.</li>
        <li>Start adding the 3 cups of hot water. When you only have about half a cup left, feel the water and keep stirring and feeling the mixed liquids as you add the water. If it's too hot, add a little cold water. If it's too cold, add more of the hot water. It should be hot enough that you feel a reaction to sticking in your finger, but not not enough that you want to pull your finger out.</li>
        <li>Mix the liquids into the flour with a large spoon.</li>
        <li>Pour remaining flour into the bowl, stirring as you go along. When it's too hard to stir, add flour onto your spoon and scrap it clean. Start kneading.</li>

    </ol>
